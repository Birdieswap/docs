As shown in the illustration, the Birdieswap interface is divided into three main areas:

1. **Navigation Bar** A persistent, top-level area that provides menus for moving between primary pages and accessing status/settings. Because it remains visible on every page, you can switch contexts quickly from anywhere.
2. **Main View (Content Area)** Your primary workspace. The content changes based on the menu you select, and nearly all Birdieswap services are performed here.
3. **Footer (Global Bottom Area)** A fixed bottom area that links to essential policy documents and the community. Since it stays anchored at the bottom, you can easily access policies and community channels from any page.

Next, let’s walk through each area in detail so you know exactly what it does and how to use it effectively.
