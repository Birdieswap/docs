My Wallet is divided into three main sections: **Menu**, **Account Information**, and **Assets & Activity Information**. Let’s go through each one in detail.

***

**① Menu**

The Menu offers three options: **Settings**, **Disconnect**, and **Close**.

* **Settings** — Opens the Settings page, where you can choose your preferred screen theme: _Auto_, _Light_, or _Dark_.
* **Disconnect** — Logs you out of the currently connected wallet account.
* **Close** — Simply closes the My Wallet panel.

***

**② Account Information**

The Account Information section displays:

* The **type of connected wallet**,
* Your **wallet address**, and
* Your **Referral Link**.

If you joined Birdieswap through a referral, your **Referrer’s address** will also be displayed.

You can:

* Click the **Copy button** to copy your wallet address or referral link.
* Click the **Minus button** next to the Referrer Address to remove it.

> ⚠️ Note: Once the Referrer Address is removed, that referrer will **no longer receive Birdieswap Points** from your activity.

To view more details about your connected account, click the **Explorer button** next to your address — this will take you directly to your wallet address page on the corresponding network explorer.

***

**③ Assets & Activity Information**

At the bottom of the My Wallet panel, you’ll find two tabs: **Assets** and **History**.

**Assets Tab**

Displays a summary of your holdings, categorized in the following order:

1. **LP Tokens** — Tokens received from providing liquidity.
2. **Staked Tokens** — LP Tokens currently staked in a farming pool.
3. **General Tokens** — Your standard (non-LP) tokens.

Each token is clickable and conveniently redirects you to the relevant Birdieswap page:

* **LP Token:** Opens the _Stake_ tab of the corresponding pool with the amount set to _Max_.
* **Staked Token:** Opens the _Unstake_ tab of the corresponding pool with the amount set to _Max_.
* **General Token:** Opens the _Swap_ page with the selected token automatically set as the _Sell_ token.

**History Tab**

The History tab shows a chronological list of all your transactions on Birdieswap in a **card-style view**. Each card includes key transaction details, and you can click any card to open the **full transaction record** on the relevant blockchain explorer.
