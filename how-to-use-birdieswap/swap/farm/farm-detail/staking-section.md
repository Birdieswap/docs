# Staking Section

The **Staking Section** manages the **staking and unstaking** of LP Tokens received from liquidity provision. If the pool offers an **Extra Reward**, this section also displays your reward accumulation and allows you to claim it.

**Stake Tab**

The **Stake Tab** consists of three components:

1. **Amount Setting Section**
2. **Execute Button**
3. **Extra Reward Section**

> _Note: Since the Extra Reward Section is the same for both the Stake and Unstake tabs, it is explained here only once._

***

**① Amount Setting Section**

You can enter any amount **within your available LP Token balance**. If no amount is entered or the entered amount exceeds your balance, the **Execute Button** remains disabled.

Click **Max** to automatically input your total LP Token balance.

Because Birdieswap Points and Extra Rewards are granted **only for staked LP Tokens**, the input field is automatically pre-filled with the **maximum available LP Token amount** by default — so you can start staking right away.

***

**② Execute Button**

Click the **Start Staking Button** to begin staking your LP Tokens. Once the transaction is confirmed, your tokens will be staked, and your Birdieswap Point and Extra Reward accumulation will start automatically.

***

**③ Extra Reward Section**

If the selected pool offers **Extra Rewards**, this section displays:

* The **Extra Reward Token icon and symbol**,
* The **accumulated reward amount**, and
* Its **USD-equivalent value**.

When claimable rewards are available, the **Claim Button** on the right becomes active. Clicking it initiates the **reward claim process**, allowing you to collect your earned Extra Reward Tokens.

**Unstake Tab**

The **Unstake Tab** shares the same structure as the Stake Tab:

1. **Amount Setting Section**
2. **Execute Button**
3. **Extra Reward Section**

***

**① Amount Setting Section**

You can enter any amount **within your staked LP Token balance**. If no amount is entered or the entered value exceeds your staked balance, the **Execute Button** remains inactive.

Click **Max** to automatically set the total number of LP Tokens you currently have staked.

***

**② Execute Button**

Click the **Stop Staking Button** to proceed with unstaking your LP Tokens. Once confirmed, your tokens will be released from staking, and your accumulated Birdieswap Points and Extra Rewards will remain recorded for your reference.
