# FARM

The **Farm Page** is where you can provide liquidity and participate in staking. At the top of the page, you’ll find the **Sorting Button**, **Filter Button**, and **Search Box**, followed by the **Farm List Table** that displays all available liquidity pools.

**① Sorting Button**

Clicking the **Sorting Button** opens the **Sorting Menu**, where you can organize the Farm List Table based on three criteria:

* **APY**
* **TVL**
* **Balance**

Each sorting option cycles through three states with every click: **descending order → ascending order → off**.

When a sorting option is active, the **Clear Button** appears. Clicking it resets the list to its default sorting order.

***

**② Filter Button**

The **Filter Button** allows you to narrow down the Farm List Table to show only pools that meet specific conditions:

* **All** — Displays all listed pools.
* **Stable** — Shows only pools that include at least one _stablecoin_ in their composition.
* **My Farm** — Displays only the pools where you have provided liquidity.

If text has been entered into the **Search Box**, the filter applies only to pools that match both the search keyword and the selected filter condition.

***

**③ Search Box**

You can use the **Search Box** to quickly find specific pools. Type one or more characters from a token name to display all listed pools that include that token.

After entering your search term, press **Enter** or click the **magnifying glass icon** to perform the search. The entered text remains in the field until you manually clear it — there’s no automatic deletion.

**④ Farm List Table**

The **Farm List Table** displays all liquidity pools currently listed on Birdieswap. Each pool entry includes:

* The **token pair icons and symbols**,
* The **fee tier** for that pool,
* The **7-day APY**,
* The **TVL** (Total Value Locked) converted to USD, and
* Your **personal liquidity amount**, shown as both **LP token quantity** and its **USD equivalent value**.

Clicking a pool entry expands the **Farm Detail** section directly below it. This expanded view provides the interface for supplying liquidity and performing staking actions within that specific pool.
