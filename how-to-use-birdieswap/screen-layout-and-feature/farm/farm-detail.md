# Farm Detail

The **Farm Detail** area is divided into three key sections: the **Farming Section**, **Information Section**, and **Staking Section**.

Through the **Farming Section**, users can provide liquidity to Birdieswap. By staking LP tokens in the **Staking Section**, users can earn **Birdieswap Points** and receive **Reward Tokens** distributed by the pool.

**① Farming Section**

This section consists of two tabs: **Start** and **Stop**.

* The **Start Tab** is used to **add liquidity** to the selected pool.
* The **Stop Tab** is used to **remove liquidity** from the pool.

These two tabs make it easy to manage your liquidity positions directly within Birdieswap.

***

**② Information Section**

The **Information Section** provides key details about the selected pool, including:

* The **Vault information** for each token pair,
* The **APR (Annual Percentage Rate)** for each component of the pool, and
* Any **Extra Rewards** and **Point rewards** available for staking.

This section helps you clearly understand the expected yield and reward composition before proceeding.

***

**③ Staking Section**

The **Staking Section** includes two tabs: **Stake** and **Unstake**.

* The **Stake Tab** allows you to deposit your LP Tokens into the pool for staking.
* The **Unstake Tab** lets you withdraw your staked LP Tokens.

If the selected pool offers **Extra Rewards**, this section also displays the reward information and provides a **Claim Button** so you can collect your accumulated rewards.
