**① Filter Button**

The **Filter Button** allows you to display only FAQ items that match specific topics.

Currently, the available filters are:

* **General**
* **Swap**
* **Farm**
* **Troubleshooting**

Clicking a filter displays only the questions related to that topic in the FAQ Table.

> ⚙️ The available filter categories may change, be added, or removed over time depending on user inquiries and feedback.

**② Search Box**

You can type **one or more characters** into the Search Box to instantly filter FAQs that contain your input in either the **question** or **answer** text.

This search works in **real time** — you don’t need to press Enter or click a button. As you type, the FAQ Table dynamically updates to show only the questions that match your search term.

***

**③ FAQ Table**

The **FAQ Table** lists all frequently asked questions. Clicking any question expands it in an **accordion style**, revealing the corresponding answer directly below it.

This interactive layout helps users browse and find solutions quickly without navigating away from the page.
