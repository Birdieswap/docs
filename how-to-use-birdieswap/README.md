# How to Use Birdieswap

This guide is designed to help anyone — even those new to Birdieswap — easily understand its features and start using them with confidence. It’s divided into two main parts for your convenience.

**Part 1: Screen Layout & Feature Overview**

The Birdieswap interface consists of three key sections: the **Navigation Bar**, **Main View**, and **Footer**. Depending on your selection, the Main View allows you to access the **Swap** and **Farm** services, or view the **FAQ**.

In this section, we’ll start with common interface elements such as the Navigation Bar menu, point card, and network/wallet connection. Then we’ll walk you through the structure and functions of the Swap and Farm screens — including what each button does and how they work together.

Because **Swap** and **Farm** are the most frequently used features, we’ve provided detailed explanations of every interaction point — from input fields and auto-calculations to sorting, filtering, starting/stopping farming, staking, and information popovers. By the end of this part, you’ll be able to navigate the interface smoothly just by following along.

**Part 2: Tutorial**

The Tutorial section lets you **learn by doing**. You’ll go step-by-step through Birdieswap’s core services — **Swap**, **Farm**, **Staking**, and **Reward Claim** — while understanding their purpose, structure, and setup.

Each tutorial explains the service’s goal, how to configure it, what to expect during the process, and what to watch out for. By simply following the tutorial, you’ll be able to use Birdieswap’s main features on your own. And if you ever come across an unfamiliar element, you can quickly refer back to Part 1 (Screen Layout & Feature Overview) for clarification.

We hope the following pages will be your helpful guide to exploring and using Birdieswap with confidence and ease.
