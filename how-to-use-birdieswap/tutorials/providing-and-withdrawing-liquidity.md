# Providing and Withdrawing Liquidity

To earn both **interest income and trading fee rewards** on Birdieswap, you’ll need to provide liquidity.

At first glance, liquidity provision might seem complex — but in practice, it’s **very simple and straightforward**. Through this tutorial, you’ll learn how to start providing liquidity and begin enjoying the two types of rewards Birdieswap offers.

***

**Selecting a Pool for Liquidity Provision**

The most important — and sometimes the hardest — part of providing liquidity is **choosing which pool to supply**.

Click the **FARM** button to open the **Farm List Table**, then browse through the available pools. Once you’ve decided which pool you want to provide liquidity to, simply click that row to open the **Farm Detail** window.

That’s it — the most difficult step is already done! From here, you can proceed to supply liquidity directly within the selected pool and start earning your rewards.

#### Providing Liquidity <a href="#providing-liquidity" id="providing-liquidity"></a>

**1. Setting Up Liquidity Provision**

Once you’ve decided which pool to provide liquidity to, follow these steps to configure your initial setup:

① Click the **selected liquidity pool** in the **Farm List Table** to open the **Farm Detail** window. ② Liquidity provision is performed in the **Start Tab**.

* Make sure the active tab is **Start**. If it isn’t, click the **Start Tab** to switch. ③ If the selected pool includes **ETH**, choose whether to provide liquidity using **ETH** or **WETH** by clicking your preferred option.
* In this tutorial, we’ll select **WETH**.
* If the pool does not contain ETH, this slider will not appear. ④ Enter the amount of tokens you want to provide in the **input field**.
* When you enter a value for one token, the other is automatically calculated to maintain a **1:1 value ratio**. ⑤ Click **Max** to automatically set the input based on the **maximum amount of the token with the lower total value** in your wallet.

In this tutorial example, we’ll enter **0.5 WETH** as the amount to provide.

***

**2. Approving Token Usage**

Because liquidity provision requires **two tokens**, you’ll need to approve each one before proceeding.

The approval process is identical to **“2. Approving Token Usage”** in the Swapping Tokens section, so you can refer there for details.

After both tokens are approved, the **lock icons** and **Approve Buttons** will disappear from the input fields, and the **Start Farming Button** will become active.

**3. Providing Liquidity**

Once setup and approvals are complete, you can now proceed with the actual liquidity provision:

① Click the **Start Farming Button**. ② The **Transaction Status Pop-over** will appear, showing _“Confirm Transaction in Wallet”_ along with your selected liquidity parameters.

* Your connected wallet will automatically prompt a **transaction request** for liquidity provision. ③ In your wallet, review the transaction request window.
* It will show the expected changes, including the **liquidity amounts** you’re adding and the **LP Tokens** you’ll receive.
* After reviewing, click the **Confirm Button** in the lower-right corner. ④ Once confirmed, the wallet window closes and the pop-over updates to _“Transaction Submitted.”_
* Click **View on Explorer** to monitor transaction progress and details. ⑤ When the transaction is confirmed, the pop-over changes to _“Success!”_, completing the liquidity provision.
* The displayed value now shows the **actual LP Token amount received** after the transaction is finalized.
* You can review the full transaction on the **blockchain explorer**, and by clicking **“Add Birdieswap USDC 3000 WETH to wallet”**, you can **register the LP Token** in your wallet for easy tracking.

#### Withdrawing Liquidity <a href="#withdrawing-liquidity" id="withdrawing-liquidity"></a>

**1. Setting Up Liquidity Withdrawal**

<figure><img src="https://crypttempo.gitbook.io/birdieswap/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3718254475-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fl809DnxvErlAtMYeaBDi%252Fuploads%252FwILsQ3OVJ113Z3oSkwAr%252F%25E1%2584%2589%25E1%2585%25B3%25E1%2584%258F%25E1%2585%25B3%25E1%2584%2585%25E1%2585%25B5%25E1%2586%25AB%25E1%2584%2589%25E1%2585%25A3%25E1%2586%25BA%25202025-10-15%2520%25E1%2584%258B%25E1%2585%25A9%25E1%2584%2592%25E1%2585%25AE%25204.14.29.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D3fcb090f-b53c-4bfe-9405-e290c3f5605f&#x26;width=768&#x26;dpr=4&#x26;quality=100&#x26;sign=4ca9e9ab&#x26;sv=2" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To withdraw liquidity from a pool, open the **Farm Detail** view of the desired pool and click the **Stop Tab**. Then follow these steps:

① If the selected pool includes **ETH**, choose whether to receive your withdrawn tokens as **ETH** or **WETH** by clicking your preferred option.

* In this tutorial, we’ll select **WETH** for demonstration.
* If the pool does not include ETH, this slider option will not appear.

② Enter the **amount of liquidity** you want to withdraw in the input field.

* When you enter a value, the **Receive Summary Box** below automatically calculates and displays the **expected token amounts** you will receive.

③ Click **Max** to automatically input your **entire LP Token balance**.

④ If necessary, click the **Approve Button** to grant permission for your LP Tokens to be used in the withdrawal.

* The approval process is identical to **“2. Approving Token Usage”** in the Swapping Tokens section, so refer there if needed.
* We’ll skip the detailed explanation here.

* You can also verify all transaction details on the **blockchain explorer**.
