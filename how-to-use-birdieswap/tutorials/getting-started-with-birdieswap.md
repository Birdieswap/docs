# Getting Started with Birdieswap

To start using Birdieswap’s services, you’ll need to go through two simple steps:

1. **Connecting your wallet**
2. **Signing the User Agreement, Privacy Policy, and Risk Disclosure**

***

**1. Connecting Your Wallet**

Like most other DeFi protocols, Birdieswap doesn’t require a separate account or identity verification. You can start using all services simply by **connecting your crypto wallet**.

Follow these steps to connect your wallet:

① Click the **Connect Wallet** button to open the **Wallet Select Menu**. ② From the menu, click **MetaMask** (or choose a different wallet if you use another one). ③ In MetaMask, review the connection request and click the **Connect** button. ④ Once connected, the **Connect Wallet** button will change to **My Wallet**.

When the **My Wallet** button is visible, your wallet is successfully connected. If you wish to disconnect it later, open the **My Wallet Menu** and click the **Disconnect** button at the top-right corner.

***

**2. Signing the User Agreement, Privacy Policy, and Risk Disclosure**

Before using Birdieswap’s services, you must read and agree to the **User Agreement**, **Privacy Policy**, and **Risk Disclosure Notice**. This signature confirms that you understand and accept the key operational and risk-related terms of the platform.

Your signature is collected **only once**, when you first access Birdieswap. As long as the policies remain unchanged, you won’t need to sign again. When you revisit Birdieswap, the system will automatically verify your signature on the server, allowing seamless access without additional steps.
