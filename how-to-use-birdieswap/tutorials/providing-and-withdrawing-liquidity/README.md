# Providing and Withdrawing Liquidity

To earn both **interest income and trading fee rewards** on Birdieswap, you’ll need to provide liquidity.

**Selecting a Pool for Liquidity Provision**

The most important — and sometimes the hardest — part of providing liquidity is **choosing which pool to supply**.

Click the **FARM** button to open the **Farm List Table**, then browse through the available pools. Once you’ve decided which pool you want to provide liquidity to, simply click that row to open the **Farm Detail** window.

That’s it — the most difficult step is already done! From here, you can proceed to supply liquidity directly within the selected pool and start earning your rewards.
