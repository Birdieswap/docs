To withdraw liquidity from a pool, open the **Farm Detail** view of the desired pool and click the **Stop Tab**. Then follow these steps:

① If the selected pool includes **ETH**, choose whether to receive your withdrawn tokens as **ETH** or **WETH** by clicking your preferred option.

* In this tutorial, we’ll select **WETH** for demonstration.
* If the pool does not include ETH, this slider option will not appear.

② Enter the **amount of liquidity** you want to withdraw in the input field.

* When you enter a value, the **Receive Summary Box** below automatically calculates and displays the **expected token amounts** you will receive.

③ Click **Max** to automatically input your **entire LP Token balance**.

④ If necessary, click the **Approve Button** to grant permission for your LP Tokens to be used in the withdrawal.

* The approval process is identical to **“2. Approving Token Usage”** in the Swapping Tokens section, so refer there if needed.
* We’ll skip the detailed explanation here.

Once your settings and approvals are complete, you can proceed with the actual liquidity withdrawal by following these steps:

① Click the **Stop Farming Button**. ② The **Transaction Status Pop-over** will appear, showing _“Confirm Transaction in Wallet”_ along with your configured withdrawal details.

* Your connected wallet will automatically prompt a **transaction request** for the liquidity withdrawal.

③ In your wallet, review the **transaction request window**.

* It will display the **expected output values** based on your withdrawal settings, including the tokens you will receive.
* After confirming the details, click the **Confirm Button** in the lower-right corner.

④ Once confirmed, your wallet window will close and the pop-over will update to _“Transaction Submitted.”_

* Click **View on Explorer** to track transaction progress and details on the blockchain.

⑤ When the transaction is complete, the pop-over changes to _“Success!”_, confirming that the withdrawal has been finalized.

* The displayed value now shows the **actual amount of tokens received** after the transaction.
* You can also verify all transaction details on the **blockchain explorer**.
