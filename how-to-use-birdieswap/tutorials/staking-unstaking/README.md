# Staking, Unstaking

If you’ve provided liquidity and now hold **LP Tokens**, you can **stake them** to earn **Birdieswap Points**. Additionally, if the selected pool offers an **Extra Reward**, you can also receive that distribution — allowing you to enjoy **higher overall returns**.

Both **Staking** and **Unstaking** are performed in the **Staking Section**, located at the **bottom-right corner of the Farm Detail** panel. With just a few simple settings, you can easily start staking or unstaking your LP Tokens in seconds.
