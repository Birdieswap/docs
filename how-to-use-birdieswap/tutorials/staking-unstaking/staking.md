Staking is performed in the **Stake Tab**, and you can complete it by following these simple steps:

① Enter the **amount of LP Tokens** you want to stake in the input field.

* The default value is automatically set to your **total LP Token balance**.
* You can also click **Max** to instantly input your full LP Token amount.

② Click the **Start Staking Button** to begin staking.

③ A **Transaction Status Pop-over** will appear with the message _“Confirm Transaction in Wallet.”_

* Your connected wallet will open a **transaction request window**.
* Review the details carefully, then click **Confirm** in the lower-right corner.

④ Once confirmed, the wallet window will close and the pop-over will update to _“Transaction Submitted.”_

* You can click **View on Explorer** to view detailed transaction information on the blockchain.

⑤ When the transaction is successfully completed, the pop-over will display _“Success!”_, confirming that staking is finished.

* Your staked LP Tokens can now be viewed in **My Wallet → Assets Tab**.
* You can also check full staking details directly on the **blockchain explorer**.
