# Service Process

Birdieswap supports two primary functions: Swap and Pair Token(LP) Farming.

The following outlines how each process operates. Although nearly all processes within Birdieswap are automated—so that users need not understand the underlying mechanics—this explanation will be helpful for those wishing to gain a deeper understanding of the service.

For users primarily interested in how to operate the service rather than its technical details, please refer to the “How to Use Birdieswap” section available in the menu.
