# Staking

Birdieswap Staking **does not create a new AMM or route assets into an additional yield-generating vault**. Instead, it functions as an **on-chain incentive layer** for the Birdieswap LP tokens you receive when providing liquidity in Birdieswap Farm. **Your base earnings** (underlying protocol yield and DEX trading fees) continue to accrue from the original LP position; **staking simply tracks balances and distributes additional rewards and other incentives**, and participation is entirely optional.

#### What you stake <a href="#what-you-stake" id="what-you-stake"></a>

* The **Birdieswap LP tokens** issued when you supply liquidity on Birdieswap.

#### What you get <a href="#what-you-get" id="what-you-get"></a>

* **Additional rewards** (e.g., tokens) and **other incentives** defined by the program.
* Your LP position continues to accrue its **base earnings** as usual; staking simply **adds an incentive layer** on top.

#### How it operates <a href="#how-it-operates" id="how-it-operates"></a>

* The staking contract records each user’s LP balance (or share) and **accrues/settles incentives on-chain** according to the program’s policy.
* Rewards can be **claimed on demand**. Program-specific terms (reward assets, accrual/settlement logic, campaign windows) are disclosed per campaign.

#### Lock and exit policy <a href="#lock-and-exit-policy" id="lock-and-exit-policy"></a>

* **No time lock. No deposit/withdrawal restrictions.** You may **stake or unstake any amount at any time**.
* On exit, any un-settled rewards are processed per policy; some programs may require a separate claim.

#### Why stake <a href="#why-stake" id="why-stake"></a>

* Simply **holding** Birdieswap LP tokens in your wallet **does not activate extra incentives**.
* If you wish to earn **additional rewards or other incentives**, staking those LP tokens is advantageous. Your base earnings remain intact while the incentive layer is added on top.

#### Notes <a href="#notes" id="notes"></a>

* Incentive rates and policies may **change over time**, and network **gas fees** apply.
* See the relevant campaign/program notice for supported pools, reward assets, and payout cadence.

> In short, Birdieswap Staking is a **lightweight, on-chain layer** that preserves the LP position’s base earnings while enabling **additional rewards and other incentives** through a standard interface.
