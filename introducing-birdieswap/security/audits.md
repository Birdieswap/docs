# Audits (TBD)

The Birdieswap team is currently in the process of preparing materials and documentation for an external security audit.\
A professional audit will be commissioned soon to ensure the robustness and reliability of all deployed smart contracts.

In addition, a public bug bounty program is planned to be introduced in the near future, encouraging independent researchers and the broader community to contribute to improving the protocolâ€™s security.
