# Rewards System

Birdieswap awards rewards to users who engage in swap transactions through its service.

When a swap is executed, a portion of the trading fee income accumulates in the relevant pool. Once the yield surpasses the predefined threshold, an automatic harvest is triggered, and the resulting yield is distributed to users in the form of Birdieswap Rewards.

Birdieswap Rewards are issued for operational purposes and can be viewed by connecting oneâ€™s wallet to the Birdieswap service.&#x20;

\[TBD]

While the Rewards may later be used in leaderboards, events, or to grant special benefits, no definitive plans have been finalized as of yet.
