# Privacy Policy

### 1. Overview

Birdieswap is a decentralized, non-custodial protocol. We do not collect, store, or manage users’ personal data on the blockchain. All transactions occur directly between users and smart contracts without intermediaries.

This Privacy Policy explains what limited off-chain information may be collected through our website or user interface (the “Interface”), how it is used, and how we protect it. By accessing or using Birdieswap’s Interface, you agree to the practices described below.

### 2. Data We Collect

Birdieswap collects only the minimum data necessary to operate and improve the Interface.

* **Wallet Address:** When connecting your wallet, your address may be visible to the Interface but is not stored or controlled by Birdieswap.
* **Technical Data:** Browser type, operating system, and device information may be collected automatically for performance optimization.
* **Usage Analytics:** Aggregated, non-identifiable statistics (e.g., page views, feature usage) may be collected to understand and enhance user experience.
* **Voluntary Contact Information:** If you contact us (e.g., via feedback or email), we may receive your name, email address, and message content for support purposes.

We do **not** collect sensitive personal identifiers (such as national ID, address, or financial information).

### 3. Use of Information

We use collected data solely to:

* Operate, maintain, and improve the Interface and related services.
* Detect technical issues and ensure security.
* Respond to user inquiries or feedback.
* Comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations, if required.

All analytics data are aggregated or anonymized; they do not identify any individual.&#x20;

### 4. Cookies & Tracking

We use a small number of cookies or similar technologies to:

* Enable essential website functionality.
* Measure aggregated site traffic and performance.

You can manage or disable cookies through your browser settings at any time.\
Birdieswap does not use cookies for advertising or user profiling.

### 5. Third-Party Services

Birdieswap may integrate third-party tools such as analytics platforms, bug-tracking systems, or external wallet connections. These third-party services may collect limited information under their own privacy policies. We encourage users to review the privacy terms of any external wallets or tools they use.

### 6. Data Security

We apply industry-standard encryption, secure connections (HTTPS), and minimal-data practices.\
However, no online system is fully immune to risks. All transactions executed via smart contracts are public, immutable, and recorded on the blockchain. Users are responsible for the safekeeping of their wallet keys and devices.

### 7. Data Retention & Deletion

Birdieswap retains off-chain data only as long as necessary for legitimate operational or legal purposes.\
Due to the immutable nature of blockchain, on-chain data cannot be modified or deleted. Users may request deletion of off-chain contact data by emailing: [**legal@birdieswap.com**](mailto:legal@birdieswap.com).

### 8. Children’s Privacy

The Services are not intended for individuals under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect information from minors. If such data is discovered, it will be promptly deleted.

### 9. Policy Updates

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Any revisions will be posted on this page with the updated date. Continued use of the Interface after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
