# Terms of Service

#### 1. Purpose

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Birdieswap website and interface (collectively, the “Services”) operated by Birdieswap Labs (“Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).

By using the Services, you acknowledge that Birdieswap provides decentralized financial infrastructure and agree to be bound by these Terms and our \[Privacy Policy].

#### 2. Scope and Nature of the Services

1. Birdieswap does not operate as a centralized exchange, broker, or custodian. The Services provide infrastructure that connects and optimizes existing DeFi protocols through non-custodial smart contracts.
2. The Company does not control the underlying blockchain networks or smart contracts that execute user transactions.
3. Information and tools offered through the Services are for general informational purposes only and do not constitute investment, financial, or tax advice.

#### 3. Modification and Availability

1. We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Services at our discretion.
2. When possible, at least fifteen (15) days’ advance notice will be provided for planned service suspension. However, emergency actions due to technical, regulatory, or security reasons may occur without prior notice.
3. Users will be given a reasonable opportunity to withdraw funds or disconnect wallets, but we are not responsible for losses caused by third-party blockchain failures or force majeure events.

#### 4. User Responsibilities

You agree to use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and applicable laws.\
You must not:

* Engage in money laundering, terrorist financing, or illegal transactions;
* Attempt unauthorized access, hacking, or exploit of smart contracts;
* Use stolen or fraudulently obtained funds;
* Transmit malicious code or automated data scraping;
* Misrepresent your identity or act on behalf of others without authorization.

Birdieswap Labs reserves the right to restrict access or report suspicious activity where violations are suspected.

#### 5. Taxes and Compliance

Users are solely responsible for determining, reporting, and paying any applicable taxes or duties related to their use of the Services. Birdieswap Labs does not provide tax or accounting advice and does not collect or remit taxes on behalf of users unless required by law.

#### 6. Risk Disclosure

1. Birdieswap and its integrated protocols operate on experimental, permissionless blockchain systems that involve significant risks.
2. Displayed yields (e.g., APR or APY) are forward-looking estimates and not guaranteed.
3. Dual-yield strategies may not always be achievable; actual performance may vary due to gas fees, slippage, or external protocol conditions.
4. Birdieswap integrates external protocols (e.g., liquidity and yield sources) and has no control over their governance, upgrades, or operations.
5. Users must perform independent due diligence and assume full responsibility for any financial or technical risks.

#### 7. Limitation of Liability

1. The Company is only liable for direct damages resulting from its willful misconduct or gross negligence.
2. Except in such cases, total liability to any user shall not exceed USD 100.
3. The Company shall not be liable for damages arising from:

* Loss or compromise of private keys or wallet credentials;
* Blockchain network malfunctions, forks, or consensus failures;
* Regulatory changes, government actions, or sanctions;
* Events beyond our control, including cyberattacks or force majeure.

#### 8. Dispute Resolution and Governing Law

1. These Terms are governed by the laws of the Republic of Korea.
2. Parties shall first attempt to resolve any dispute through good-faith negotiation.
3. If unresolved, disputes shall be settled by **binding arbitration** under the rules of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (ICDR).

* The seat of arbitration shall be Seoul, Republic of Korea.
* The arbitration shall be conducted in Korean or English, at the claimant’s choice.

&#x20; 4\. Mandatory consumer protection laws of a user’s jurisdiction shall prevail where applicable.

#### 9. Miscellaneous

1. If any provision of these Terms is found invalid, the remaining provisions shall remain effective.
2. We may amend these Terms at any time. Updated versions will take effect upon posting to the Birdieswap website. Continued use of the Services constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
