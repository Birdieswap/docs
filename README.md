# Welcome to Birdieswap

Welcome to Birdieswap!

Birdieswap is an innovative software tool designed within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem **to enable users to earn “interest income” and “trading fee income”** **SIMULTANEOUSLY** by utilizing their cryptocurrencies. Whereas traditional DeFi platforms typically allow users to benefit from only one of these two principal yield models—either interest or fees—Birdieswap empowers you to continuously enjoy both streams of income with just a single liquidity provision.

We invite you to join Birdieswap and embrace a smarter approach to yield farming.

### Disclaimer

While users may engage in yield farming by utilizing the smart contracts provided on the Birdieswap website, please note that returns are determined by the third-party protocols selected as underlying investment targets, and thus, the principal is not guaranteed to be 100%.

Birdieswap does not manage, custody, or hold ownership of your assets. Although the team have been working with best efforts to minimize vulnerabilities, there may still exist as-yet undiscovered issues.

Users must fully acknowledge and assume complete responsibility for their use of Birdieswap, including any losses incurred as a result of its operation. Furthermore, all information contained in this document is provided solely for educational purposes; Birdieswap does not offer any investment recommendations or advice.
